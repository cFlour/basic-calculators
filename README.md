# basic-calculators
Basic calculators made by me.

## How to use?
Select the file for which you want the calculator. The files are named according to the figures for which the calculators are. Copy the contents of the file into Visual Studio code (if you are on a computer) or Jupyter notebook. If you are on mobile, copy it to pyroid.
Then run the file, enter the neccesary inputs and lo! the calculator works.
